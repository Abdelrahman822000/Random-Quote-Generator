# Quote Generator

The Quote Generator app is designed to provide quotes based on user emotions, with a chain of responsibility pattern to handle different types of emotions.

## Example

Let’s illustrate this with a creative example named “Emotional Quotes.”

## About the App

The Quote Generator app categorizes quotes into different emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral). Depending on the user's emotion, the app fetches a relevant quote from the appropriate category. 

## App Task

In this scenario, whenever the user interacts with the app (initiated by pressing buttons), a quote is displayed based on the user's selected emotion. The app also supports storing and restoring quotes states using a backup mechanism.

# Instructions

1. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary Qt libraries installed.
2. **Build the App:** Compile the app using your preferred C++ compiler. Make sure to include the Qt framework.
3. **Prepare Files:**
   - Ensure all header and source files are in the same directory.
4. **Run the App:**
   - Execute the compiled binary to start the application.

# How to Use

- **Press Store:** To store the current state of quotes.
- **Press Restore:** To restore a previously stored quote state.
