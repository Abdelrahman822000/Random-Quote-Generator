# Quote Generator

The Quote Generator app is designed to provide quotes based on user emotions, with a chain of responsibility pattern to handle different types of emotions.

## About the App

The Quote Generator app categorizes quotes into different emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral). Depending on the user's emotion, the app fetches a relevant quote from the appropriate category. 

## App Task

In this scenario, whenever the user interacts with the app (initiated by pressing Start Button), a quote is displayed based on the user's selected emotion. The app also supports storing and restoring quotes states using a backup mechanism.
